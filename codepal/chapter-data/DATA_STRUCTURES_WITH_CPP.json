                "lesson_description": "Like other programming languages, array in C++ is a group of similar types of elements that have contiguous memory location.In C++ std::array is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays. In C++, array index starts from 0. We can store only fixed set of elements in C++ array.A collection of related data items stored in adjacent memory places is referred to as an array in the C/C++ programming language or any other programming language for that matter. Elements of an array can be accessed arbitrarily using its indices. They can be used to store a collection of any type of primitive data type, including int, float, double, char, etc. An array in C/C++ can also store derived data types like structures, pointers, and other data types, which is an addition. The array representation in a picture is provided below.",
